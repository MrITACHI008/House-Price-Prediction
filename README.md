# 🏡 House Price Prediction Model

Welcome to my **House Price Prediction** project! 📊 In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the prices of houses based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use **data science** and **machine learning** techniques to accurately predict house prices. This could be super helpful for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents who want to get a good estimate of property prices based on specific features.

### What I did:
- Collected a dataset with house features and prices 💾
- Cleaned and processed the data 🧹
- Explored the data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊
- Built a **machine learning model** (Linear Regression) to predict prices 🔮
- Evaluated the model and fine-tuned it for better accuracy 📈

## 📂 Project Structure
- `House_Price_prediction.ipynb`: This is the Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for the project.
- `data/`: The folder containing the dataset used for training the model.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models for future use.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization 📊
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning

## 📉 Model Performance
I used **mean squared error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)** metrics to evaluate the model’s performance. Here’s a quick summary of how the model performed:

- **Training Accuracy**: XX%
- **Test Accuracy**: XX%

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Improved my understanding of data preprocessing and feature engineering 🛠️
- Learned how to handle missing data and outliers 🚨
- Practiced model evaluation techniques like **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** 🧩

## 📈 Next Steps
- Explore advanced models like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** 🌲
- Implement feature scaling and regularization to improve accuracy 🚀
- Fine-tune the model using **GridSearchCV** for better predictions
